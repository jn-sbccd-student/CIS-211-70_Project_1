			<h2> About us </h2>
			<p> We're a studio located in within a small city of the Inland Empire, a 1 to 2 hour drive away from Los Angeles here to address the needs of those who need assistance with glass work.</p>
			<p> The goal of being here and doing the work that we do is to provide more of an exposure for the people of the city to an art form that's rarely accessible and available for people to become inspired in. We hope that you'll join us on this wonderful adventure to enriching people's lives by being involved and working with glass and the community!   </p>
			
			<h2> Contact Us </h2>
			<p> If you would like to know more about us or have any questions or comments, please feel free to visit our "Contact Us" page, and we'll be sure to get in touch with you! </p>
