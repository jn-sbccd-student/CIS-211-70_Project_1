			<h2> Glassblowing Lessons </h2>
				<p> Come by over and learn how to work with hot glass straight out the furnace! We’ll cover safety and techniques appropriate based off of level. Single-person and Group options are available. You can be assured that by the end of the lesson you’ll be able to make a piece you’ll enjoy having! We’ll make contact with you after to work a time for piece pickup. </p>
